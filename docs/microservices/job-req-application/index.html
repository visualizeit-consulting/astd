        <p>In my recent search for a new job, I’ve had the pleasure of interacting with some different job search sites. I’ve been frustrated at a couple of them, one in particular, that sent me a rejection a few minutes after I saved my application as a draft (I did not submit). The rejection included phrases like “After careful consideration..” which of course was a lie. The next day I received another rejection email for the same job application that I never finished. I know that the chances are high that the site is just poorly designed and implemented and it got me thinking about how a site like this works and maybe I could write my own.</p>

<p>I think this would be a reasonable project to demonstrate the benefits of event-driven microservices with CQRS+ES because I think it’s an easy to understand Domain and can have some useful features:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Registering users</li>
  <li>Logging in with different roles (job seeker, job poster)</li>
  <li>Uploading documents (e.g. resumes or cover letters)</li>
  <li>Saving a draft to complete later</li>
  <li>Notifications and tracking changes</li>
</ul>

<p>There is a lot to do in order to get this done, particularly since I’m a team of one. My roadmap consists of the following steps:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Flesh out the requirements using Story Mapping and Event Storming/Modeling</li>
  <li>Determine a Most Viable Product from the Story Map</li>
  <li>Determine and design the bounded contexts</li>
  <li>Begin implementing the microservices</li>
</ol>

<p>In addition to those steps, I will also be planning out and creating some infrastructure for the deployment. In the beginning I’m going to need to do the
following:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Setup on-prem Kubernetes cluster</li>
  <li>Setup CI/CD infrastructure and pipelines</li>
  <li>Create Docker Compose scripts for running containers locally before before deployment to Kubernetes.</li>
</ol>
